//how to add multiple strings
const name="ritik rai";
const age=22;
console.log("hello my name is "+ name + ", I am " + age +"years old" );

console.log(`hello my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old`);
//so we can use ${variable_name} and use it all along with our text
console.log(name.length);
